# ðŸ–¤ Dark Notepad 

This is my first Python project. I used to use Notepad frequently while coding, and the white theme was hurting my eyesðŸ‘€. So, I researched how to make the Windows Notepad black-themed, and I found it wasn't very easy. In fact writing new code was easier than changing the current Notepad to dark mode so I wrote this code. Anyone can contribute and use it.

## Installation and usage
The installation and usage are very simple. Download the repository and convert the ANote.pyw file to an .exe using pyinstaller --onefile ANote.pyw. Then open the file and with Ctrl+O you can open the desired file in the black-themed Notepad and start using it
