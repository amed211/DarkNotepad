Notepad with an eye friendly black theme ðŸ‘€

# ðŸ–¤ Dark Notepad 

This is my first Python project. I used to use Notepad frequently while coding, and the white theme was hurting my eyesðŸ‘€. So, I researched how to make the Windows Notepad black-themed, and I found it wasn't very easy. In fact writing new code was easier than changing the current Notepad to dark mode so I wrote this code. Anyone can contribute and use it.

## Installation and usage
The installation and usage are very simple. Download the repository and convert the ANote.pyw file to an .exe using pyinstaller --onefile ANote.pyw. Then open the file and with Ctrl+O you can open the desired file in the black-themed Notepad and start using it

## ðŸš€ Features
Black background, white text

Shortcut keys:

Ctrl+S â†’ Save

Ctrl+C â†’ Copy

Ctrl+V â†’ Paste

Ctrl+X â†’ Cut

Ctrl++ â†’ Increase text size

Ctrl+- â†’ Decrease text size

Open/Edit files

## My Personal Opinion ðŸ§ 

In my opinion there should have been a notepad application with an eye friendly dark theme Microsoft has never shown the necessary attention to the Windows Notepad application and it has remained outdated far behind the times This led to the emergence of alternative applications one of which is Dark Notepad This code is open source and anyone can add features to Dark Notepad and improve it further I would like to thank everyone who contributes code in advance

## Thank you in advance to everyone who will contribute to my first projectðŸŽ‰âœ¨
